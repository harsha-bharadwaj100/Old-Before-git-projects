# Old-Before-git-projects
Here I'll be posting some of the little projects that I made when I started learning c++ and python during the start of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. That was when I chose CS as a subject in high school.
During those time I had little to no idea about coding, just used to do some little little programs to practice. I learnt a lot during those times.
Obviously at that time I had no idea about how to properly structure my projects. Did not know a thing about git and version control. Did not know how to properly organize code files properly hence I've no proper idea where they are.
Afterall I did those projects on some other PCs and my programs are there on those old dusty hard drives.
So whenever I find some of those code files I'll be posting them in this repository.
Thia is gonna be my most intresting repository of all time. Simply because it has a special place in my heart. It's just very nostalgic to me! :)
